Soon after Shusaku released his last move (Black 127), although Gennan seems calm, however his ears suddenly got red. This is a natural response from human body when one is panic, Black must have played an outstanding move, and White feels very hard to deal with it, so I conclude Black will win the game."]PW[Gennan Inseki]RE[B+3]PB[Honinbo Shusaku]PC[Japan]WR[8p]BR[4p]DT[1846-7-25]EV[Japan Famous Ear-reddening Game];B[qd]C[Shusaku (1829-1862) is the 14th Honinbo, he together with Honinbo Dosaku is acknowledged as "Kisei", his play is clever, temperate and refined, and he was also the originator the "Shusaku Opening" which had a big impact on Go's revolution.];W[dc]C[Gennan Inseki is the 11th head of Inoue.];B[pq]C[At the game time, Shusaku was only 17 years' old, his strength was 4p.];W[oc]C[This was the second game between them, Shusaku was allowed to take Black without giving any komi.

Notes from American Go Journal: It (B127) kills four birds with one stone by 1: reducing the influence of White's thickness on the right; 2: increasing the potential of Black's position at the top; 3: helping Black's four stones below; 4: aiming at a reduction of White's position on the left.];W[eb];B[fb];W[eg];B[dj]C[The shoulder-hit of B131 is a superb point.];W[dk];B[ej];W[cj];B[dh];W[ij]C[W136: White aims to create complications, the following variation is complicated.];B[hm];W[gj];B[eh];W[fl];B[fg];W[er]C[W142 is an asking move.];B[dm]LB[gs:a][bp:b][do:c]C[Black counterattacks fiercely with B143, if Black descends at 'a', then White can take advantage by the attachment at 'b' and the diagonal at 'c'.];W[fn];B[dn];W[gn];B[jj]C[Black already has assurance of success with B147.];W[jk];B[kk];W[ii];B[ik];W[jl];B[kl];W[il];B[jh];W[co];B[do];W[ih];B[hn];W[hl];B[bl]C[B161 is a big move.];W[dg];B[gh];W[ch]C[W162 and W164: White can only settle the shape this way.];B[ig]C[After the middle game fight comes to an end, the situation is clear, Black is a little favorable.];W[ec]C[W166 is a big endgame worth about 20 points.];B[cr]C[After Black strengthens with B167, Black wins the game for sure.];W[fd];B[gd];W[ed];B[gc];W[bk];B[cm];W[gs];B[gp];W[li];B[kg];W[in];B[lj];W[lg];B[gm];W[jf];B[jg];W[im];B[fm];W[kf];B[lf];W[mf];B[le];W[gf]C[W190 a tesuji for reduction.];B[hf]LB[ff:a][hg:b]C[Black can only answer with the diagonal of B191, if Black connects at 'a', then White will play the hane at 'b', White would break through Black's territory.];W[ff];B[gg];W[lk];B[kj];W[km];B[lm];W[ll];B[jm];W[ge];B[he];W[ee];B[ea];W[cb];B[fr];W[fs];B[dr]C[B205 and B207: The outcome of the game has been already decided.];W[qa];B[ra];W[pa];B[rb];W[da];B[gi];W[fj];B[fi];W[fa];B[ga];W[gl];B[ek];W[em];B[ho];W[el];B[en];W[jo];B[kn];W[ci];B[lh];W[mh];B[mg];W[di];B[ei];W[lg];B[qn];W[rn];B[re];W[sl];B[mg];W[bm];B[am];W[lg];B[eq];W[es];B[mg];W[ha];B[gb];W[lg];B[ds];W[hs];B[mg];W[sj];B[si];W[lg];B[sr];W[sq];B[mg];W[hd];B[hb];W[lg];B[ro];W[so];B[mg];W[ss];B[qs];W[lg];B[sn];W[rp];B[mg];W[cl];B[bn];W[lg];B[ml];W[mk];B[mg];W[pj];B[sf];W[lg];B[nn];W[nl];B[mg];W[ib];B[ia];W[lg];B[nc];W[nb];B[mg];W[jd];B[kd];W[lg];B[ma];W[na];B[mg];W[qc];B[rc];W[lg];B[js];W[ks];B[mg];W[hc];B[id];W[lg];B[fk];W[hj];B[mg];W[hh];B[hg];W[lg];B[gk];W[hk];B[mg];W[ak];B[lg];W[al];B[bm];W[nf];B[od];W[ki];B[ms];W[kp];B[ip];W[jp];B[lr];W[oj];B[mr];W[ea];B[sr]C[Black wins by 3 points in the end. ])
